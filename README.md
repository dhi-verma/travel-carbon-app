In Department for Transport, there is focus on reducing the environmental impact of day-to-day operations. One contributor to organisational carbon emissions is business travel. This includes land-based journeys and air travel.

The Government publishes official greenhouse gas (GHG) conversion factors. These are used to estimate carbon emissions. However, applying them correctly can be difficult for non-technical users. It can be time-consuming when users need to compare different travel options quickly. In many cases, these calculations are performed frequently using spreadsheets or external tools.

Another challenge is that different transport modes use different measurement bases. Some factors are measured per vehicle-kilometre. Others are measured per passenger-kilometre. This can lead to confusion or incorrect estimates. Aviation emissions can also include adjustments such as Radiative Forcing (RF). This makes interpretation harder for users who are unfamiliar with environmental reporting standards.

This project aims to address these issues by providing a simple solution. The DfT Travel Carbon Calculator is a web application that estimates carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (kgCO₂e) for land and air travel. Calculations are based on distance, transport type and number of passengers. The application displays both per-person and total journey emissions. Clear explanations are provided so users understand how results are produced.

The main users of this application include analysts, policy teams, and operational staff in DfT. These users often need to make quick, indicative comparisons between different travel options as part of planning, reporting, or decision-making activities. The app provides a simple way to estimate emissions without relying on complex spreadsheets or specialist software.
